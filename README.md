## ðŸ”¥ Real-Time Booking with **database check**
- When a user tries to book an appointment, **database check** ensures real-time availability updates.
- If another user books the same slot, others will see it as **unavailable** instantly.
- **Real-time availability is also validated with the database** to ensure that no two users can book the same time slot. When a booking is attempted, the system checks whether the given time already has a booking. If it does, the user will be notified that the time slot is taken.
